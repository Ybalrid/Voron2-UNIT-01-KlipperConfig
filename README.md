# Voron2-UNIT-01-KlipperConfig

This is the configuration files for *my* specific Voron2 build. Putting it out there for reference, and backup.

It is a 350 machine, has a klicky probe attached somewhere on the right of the gantry (for now at least, it's slightly annoying sometimes. Thinking about TAP right now)

Z endstop is on the right, and a large decontaminator purge bucket and brush is on the left.
